<h1>About Me</h1>

  I'm Jayeed, a Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate at United
  International University (UIU), passionate about full-stack web development,
  AI/ML, and problem-solving. I spend a major portion of my day coding,
  continuously striving to improve my skills in software development and machine
  learning.

  I also have a strong interest in literature, philosophy, politics, and
  nonfiction, balancing my technical expertise with a broad intellectual
  curiosity. My goal is to build efficient, scalable, and impactful solutions
  through technology while deepening my understanding of the world.

  When I’m not coding, you’ll find me watching classic films, reading, or
  exploring new ideas. Let’s connect and collaborate!
